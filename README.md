 Project Title: RePlanAI – Return Risk Prediction & Contingency Execution Engine
📝 Description:
RePlanAI is an intelligent AI-powered system that predicts product return risk based on real-time order data and proactively executes contingency actions to prevent revenue loss and operational disruption.
Built specifically for large-scale retail supply chains like Walmart’s, RePlanAI integrates ML-driven return risk modeling with automated decision-making to ensure:
Fewer product returns
Smarter inventory control
Faster vendor coordination
Better customer experience

🔍 Solution:
RePlanAI combines AI & LLMs to:
Ingest live order data (SKU, region, vendor, ETA, complaints)
Predict the likelihood of return using a trained ML model
If risk is high (e.g., >80%), automatically:
Hold inventory at fulfillment center
Alert vendors for urgent quality reporting

📦 Tech Stack:
Streamlit (frontend)
Python (backend logic)
Simulated ML + LLM (can be integrated with real models/APIs)
JSON input handling
Random forest / logistic regression model (replaceable)
Notification system (mocked)

💡 What Makes It Unique:
Combines both prediction & action — it’s not just a dashboard
Fully automates complex supply chain responses in real time
Plug-and-play for any SKU-based retail model

🎯 Impact:
Reduce return rate by 20–40%
Save millions in reverse logistics costs

🧠 Future Extensions:
Integrate real-time tracking from Walmart APIs
Connect with live vendor CRMs and SMS/email alerts
Add feedback loops to retrain the ML model with new data
